In order to compile and run program,
    1. Run command in folder "g++ *.cpp" This will compile all .cpp programs in the file, ignoring all .git files
    2. After the program is compiled, Main.cpp will generate an executable file, called by default a.out. In order to run the program, you'll have to type "./a.out", and this will run the executable. 

The above steps can be done in the Bash terminal in VSCode, or in the WSL console as well
